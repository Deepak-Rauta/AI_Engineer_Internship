# Project Overview

This is a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that combines:

1. **Document knowledge** through vector embeddings
2. **Live web search** for real-time information
3. **Gemini AI** for intelligent responses
4. **Streamlit UI** for user interaction

## ️ **Architecture Flow**

The flowchart generator shows the complete data flow:

1. **User Input** → Query processing
2. **Knowledge Check** → RAG vs Web Search decision
3. **Context Retrieval** → From documents or web
4. **Gemini AI Processing** → Generate intelligent responses
5. **Response Mode** → Concise or detailed output

Thought for 4sI'll help you create a comprehensive chatbot project with RAG capabilities using the specified tech stack. Let me start by creating a flow chart to visualize the architecture, then build the entire project.

Created RAG chatbot projectv1I've created a comprehensive RAG chatbot project with all the requested features. Here's what I've built:
